# Quick Jibri Installer
Bash installer for Jibri on **Ubuntu LTS** based systems using **nginx** as default webserver.

## Usage
As for our current latest release, as we have integrated more and more features, we highly recommend to use a purpose specific-newly spawn server to host the jitsi-meet framework, making sure you stick to the requirements and recommendations as much as possible, in order to avoid issues.


### Main Server
Login into your clean server, clone git repository and run the installer,

```
git clone https://github.com/switnet-ltd/quick-jibri-installer
cd quick-jibri-installer
bash quick-jibri-installer.sh
```

### Add Jibri node

Copy the modified `add-jibri-node.sh` file from your early cloned installation directory once it's completed to the new server meant to be a jibri node using your preferred method, then run it

**WARNING:** This file contains sensitive information from your setup, please handle with care.

```
bash add-jibri-node.sh
```

## Kernel warning
For AWS users or any cloud service provider that might use their own kernel on their products (servers/vm/vps), might cause Jibri failure to start due not allowing `snd_aloop` module.

Make sure that you update your grub to boot the right one.
